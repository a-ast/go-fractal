# TO DO

1. API to generate images as a module go-fractal/http
    - in cmd? because it is a command: start server
2. Simplify colour picker by assuming that end and start are black and fill only from gradientPoints
3. Spline and circle interpolations?
4. GIF-generator as separate module
5. More fractal types
6. Tests
